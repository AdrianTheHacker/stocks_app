### Changes to Plan
##### September 18, 2022
> 1. Switching from Rocket to Yew
    - This project now uses web assembly
    - Rocket over complicated the frontend

> 2. HTTP requests are now made using gloo_net instead of reqwests
    - Yew can't use reqwest::blocking
    - Yew's website has a great [tutorial on how to make HTTP requests using gloo_net](https://yew.rs/docs/tutorial#fetching-data-using-external-rest-api)
